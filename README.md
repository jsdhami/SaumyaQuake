## Detailed Project Description

### Moon Map

Introducing Moonquake Map 2.0, your gateway to the lunar frontier like never before! This cutting-edge tool unlocks the mysteries of the Moon by generating an immersive and detailed map, unveiling seismic secrets straight from NASA's treasure trove of data.

Prepare to be captivated as Moonquake Map 2.0 showcases shallow moonquakes with mesmerizing ripple effects, vividly illustrating their location and magnitude. But that's not all â€“ this extraordinary map takes you on a journey through the lunar landscape, unraveling its topography with precision. Explore the hallowed grounds of Apollo landing sites and other monumental lunar missions, all seamlessly integrated into this interactive masterpiece.

Behind the scenes, our developers harnessed the power of Bootstrap, weaving a sleek and intuitive frontend. With the magic of Globe.Gl JavaScript, underpinned by the versatility of Three.js, and the data manipulation wizardry of d3, Moonquake Map 2.0 brings the Moon closer than ever before. JSON/CSV data feeds fuel the engine, and React lends its brilliance to craft an interface that's not just informative but also a joy to navigate.

Discover the future of lunar exploration with Moonquake Map 2.0, where user-friendly functions make every interaction a delightful experience. Dive into a world of moonquakes, topography, and historic missions, all at your fingertips. Unlock the lunar wonders, one click at a time.

## How It Works

Upon opening the website, users are greeted with the option to view the Moonquake 2.0 template. Clicking on this option initiates an incredible scientific journey within the main interface. Here, users have access to numerous parameters for adjusting the 3D visualization of the moon. It features:

- Topography
- Meridian For Longitude 
- Luminar Landing
- Real Time Moon 
- Explore Nakamura
- Danger Zone

Users can switch between these features through toggle buttons in the main interface. The "Danger Zone" feature helps users predict the effect and danger during lunar missions, while "Nakamura Show" allows visualization of Moonquakes based on different time, date, magnitude, and location.

## Benefits

Moonquake Map 2.0 offers several benefits:

- **Seismic Activity Visualization**: Users can explore seismic activity on the moon, visualizing moonquakes in specific locations with detailed information.

- **Lunar Topography**: The map provides insights into the lunar surface's topography, enhancing our understanding of the moon's geography.

- **Reference Data**: Important historical moon mission data, such as Apollo landing sites, is readily available for reference.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool's interface is user-friendly and allows users to adjust various parameters for a customized experience.

- **Day and Night Visualization**: Users can also visualize day and night on the moon, adding an extra layer of exploration.

## What do you hope to achieve?

"Our project is a catalyst for innovation, igniting the flames of creativity and critical thinking. Through captivating data visualization, we aim to inspire the next generation of students and researchers to embark on a journey of lunar discovery, unveiling the mysteries of the Moon's surface and the enigmatic Moonquakes. Our app serves as a gateway to the cosmos, cultivating curiosity and nurturing the spirit of exploration. Moreover, it conquers the challenge of rendering lunar seismic activities in breathtaking 3D, making the lunar landscape come alive before your eyes."
