## About

Moonquake Map 2.0 is a project developed as a solution for the NASA International Space App Challenge 2023. This interactive map allows the public to visualize seismic data and informative details about moonquakes and the lunar surface.

## Detailed Project Description

### Moon Map

Moonquake Map 2.0 generates a detailed map of the moon that displays seismic data obtained from NASA resources. It visualizes shallow moonquakes with a ripple effect, showing their location and magnitude. Additionally, the map explores the lunar surface's topography and marks important locations, such as the Apollo landing sites and other moon mission data, for reference.

The map's frontend was developed using Bootstrap and leverages the Globe.Gl JavaScript library based on Three.js, along with the d3 open-source library. Other tools, including React and data in JSON/CSV format, were utilized to create an interactive and informative interface.

The tool provides easy-to-use functions to display various items on the map, enhancing the user's experience.

## How It Works

Upon opening the website, users are greeted with the option to view the Moonquake 2.0 template. Clicking on thi### option initiates an incredible scientific journey within the main interface. Here, users have access to numerous parameters for adjusting the 3D visualization of the moon. It's features:
### Topography
### Longitude & Latitude
### Luminar Landing 
### Phase and Liberation 
### Nakamura Show 
### Danger Zone
Above feature will be opened through the various toggle button given in the main interface.We have added flexibility for the users to switch between those features.Danger Zone feature helps the user to predict the effect and it's danger during the lunar missons. Through Nakamura Show they can visualize the Moonquakes occur in different time ,date , magnitude and location.


## Benefits

Moonquake Map 2.0 offers several benefits:

- **Seismic Activity Visualization**: Users can explore seismic activity on the moon, visualizing moonquakes in specific locations with detailed information.

- **Lunar Topography**: The map provides insights into the lunar surface's topography, enhancing our understanding of the moon's geography.

- **Reference Data**: Important historical moon mission data, such as Apollo landing sites, is readily available for reference.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool's interface is user-friendly and allows users to adjust various parameters for a customized experience.

- **Day and Night Visualization**: Users can also visualize day and night on the moon, adding an extra layer of exploration.

## What do you hope to achieve ?

We hope our project may create a great impact on innovation, creativity, critical thinking, data visualization and inspiration field among the new generation and present students and researchers about the lunar surface and Moonquakes. This helps to create a interest to know more about space and science. As every student and researcher are keen to learn about the new things and their impact on daily life. This app also solves the problem about the data visualization of different seismic activity on lunar surface as it is vizulazied in 3D Moon with salient features.
