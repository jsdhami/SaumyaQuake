#Detailed Project Description 

Moon Map

This project produce the map of the moon depicting the seismic data from NASA Resources which visualize the shallow moonquakes with ripple effect ,it's location and magnitude and exploring the lunar surface as well as it's topography. The Apollo landing location and other moon mission data are also displayed for reference.

The map frontend was developed through bootstrap and for globe Globe.Gl JavaScript library which is based on Three.js, and d3 open source library. Other tools like react and Json/csv/ data type is used. 

The tool provides easy way  to use function to display various items on map.

#How does it work?

When you first open the website you will be welcomed with the guesture of View Moonquake-2.0 template. After clicking on it you will be starting the incredible and scientific journey in the main interface. Here you will find many parameters for adjusting which helps you to visualize the moon in 3D form.


#What benefits does it have?

Our project tackles the challenge by providing the solution about 3D interface for users to visualize the seismic activity in the moon and more about the moonquakes that were occured in the specific location. Users can depict the location through longitude and latitude grids. They can also visualize the topography of lunar surface,day and night in the moon.
