## Detailed Project Description

### Moon Map

Moonquake Map 2.0 generates a detailed map of the moon that displays seismic data obtained from NASA resources. It visualizes shallow moonquakes with a ripple effect, showing their location and magnitude. Additionally, the map explores the lunar surface's topography and marks important locations, such as the Apollo landing sites and other moon mission data, for reference.

The map's frontend was developed using Bootstrap and leverages the Globe.Gl JavaScript library based on Three.js, along with the d3 open-source library. Other tools, including React and data in JSON/CSV format, were utilized to create an interactive and informative interface.

The tool provides easy-to-use functions to display various items on the map, enhancing the user's experience.

## How It Works

Upon opening the website, users are greeted with the option to view the Moonquake 2.0 template. Clicking on this option initiates an incredible scientific journey within the main interface. Here, users have access to numerous parameters for adjusting the 3D visualization of the moon.

## Benefits

Moonquake Map 2.0 offers several benefits:

- **Seismic Activity Visualization**: Users can explore seismic activity on the moon, visualizing moonquakes in specific locations with detailed information.

- **Lunar Topography**: The map provides insights into the lunar surface's topography, enhancing our understanding of the moon's geography.

- **Reference Data**: Important historical moon mission data, such as Apollo landing sites, is readily available for reference.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool's interface is user-friendly and allows users to adjust various parameters for a customized experience.

- **Day and Night Visualization**: Users can also visualize day and night on the moon, adding an extra layer of exploration.
